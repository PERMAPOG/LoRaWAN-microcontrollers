# Traveling Trash Man (TTM) Nodes
This repository contains the node code for the TTM system, compatible with the HTC-AB01v2 and HTC-AB02 LoRaWAN development boards.

## Setup Instructions
To get started, you'll need to upload the code to your HTC device using the Arduino IDE. Ensure that you have the following details ready:

LoRaWAN Device EUI
Application Key
These values need to be updated in the code before uploading it to your LoRaWAN nodes.

## Wiring Diagram
Below is the wiring diagram for setting up the hardware. This diagram demonstrates the connections needed for the sensors and components used in the TTM node.
